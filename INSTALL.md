# Installation Guide

The installation process is straightforward and non-persistent. Follow the steps below for your respective operating system.

## Windows

1. Download the executable.
2. Run the executable in any directory/folder.
3. The program will create a folder called `shared_files` in the directory where it is executed.
4. Any files placed in the `shared_files` folder will become sharable.
5. You can also add files to the folder by uploading them via the browser interface.

## Linux and macOS

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where your executable (`polyShare-preview`) is located.
3. Before running the executable, ensure it has the correct permissions. Run the following command to give it executable permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x polyshare-vx.x.x
   ```

4. After setting permissions, run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./polyShare-preview
   ```

Once executed, the application will create a folder named `shared_files`, where you can manage your sharable files.
